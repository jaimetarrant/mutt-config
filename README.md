# Mutt Configuration

I'll write this readme properly soon.

For now, you might find something interesting in here, my config has the
following features:

 - Uses Maildir
 - Supports multiple accounts
 - Fetchmail + procmail + spamassassin to get mail
 - msmtp to send mail
 - goobook for address lookup
